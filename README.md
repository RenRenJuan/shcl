<span style="font-size: 12px">Divergence from original devloper's pkg</span>

>  The first point of divergence is that the original pkg is oriented toward generic posix shell and this line supports the mcpcms variant of zsh. 

Ultimately I expect this code to evolve into WFL. Something drastic will be done early on to get closer to my original intent of a synthesis of 
cl and (an actual) shell (e.g. mcpcms) vs the source pkg which is more of a posix shell emulation in lisp that can exec.
